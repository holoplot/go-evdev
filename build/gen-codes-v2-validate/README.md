# Purpose
`gen-codes-v2-validate` is a simple program that validate generated `codes.go` string mappings 
("Type to String" and "Type from String" sections) by matching them against each other.

# Usage
Move generated `codes.go` (by `gen-codes-v2`) to `gen-codes-v2-validate/evdev` and just run with `go run ./main.go`
